The API for this doesn't work perfectly though so if you try to switch to a project that is already open in dev mode, a new window will open.\n\n### `icon:`\nThis changes the icon displayed next to the project title in the list view. The icon is class-based, so you can either use the classes already provided by Atom like `icon-squirrel` or make your own class (target `:before`). The GitHub [octicon](https://github.com/styleguide/css/7.0) font is available to use, and most, if not all classes, just replace `octicon-` with `icon-`.\n\n### Example\n```CoffeeScript\n'Project Manager':\n  'title': 'Project Manager'\n  'icon': 'icon-squirrel'\n  'devMode': true\n  'paths': [\n    '/path/to/project-manager'\n  ]\n  'settings':\n    'editor.tabLength': 2\n    'editor.showIndentGuide': false\n    'project-manager:showPath': true\n```\n\n## Package Settings\n**Show Path:** Shows the path in the list view\n\n**Close Current:** Closes the current window before opening the new project\n\n**Environment Specific Projects:** Use `projects.[hostname].cson` instead of `projects.cson`\n\n**Sort By Title:** Sorts the projects list by title in ascending order",
